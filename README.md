# Python Projects â€“ Data Analysis Using Python (DataCamp)

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects I completed as part of the **"Data Analysis using Python"** course on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

Each project focuses on real-world datasets and demonstrates essential data skills such as data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

Each folder contains a standalone project with its own notebook and resources:

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Note

All projects were developed and completed within **DataCamp's DataLab environment** as part of my hands-on learning experience.
