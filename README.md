# Python Projects – Data Analysis Using Python (DataCamp)

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects I completed as part of the **"Data Analysis using Python"** course on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

Each project focuses on real-world datasets and demonstrates essential data skills such as data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 📂 Project List

Each folder contains a standalone project with its own notebook and resources:

- `Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores`
- `Investigating Netflix Movies`
- *(More coming soon...)*

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Note

All projects were developed and completed within **DataCamp's DataLab environment** as part of my hands-on learning experience.
